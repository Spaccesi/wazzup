# WazzUp!

WazzUp! is a personal Flutter app project, carefully crafted to showcase my skills and expertise in mobile application development. As a WhatsApp clone app, WazzUp! replicates the core functionalities and features of the original messaging platform while adding my own unique touch. Using the versatile Flutter framework, I have created a dynamic and user-friendly app that delivers a seamless and immersive experience on iOS, Android and web platforms.

## Features

Just like its inspiration, WazzUp! allows users to send text messages, and share various types of media, such as photos, videos, and documents.

## Getting Started

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

-   `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
-   ``
